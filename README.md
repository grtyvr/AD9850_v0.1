# AD9850_v0.1
Initial version of the 328p based AD9850 function generator.

It is based on the project:

http://www.vwlowen.co.uk/arduino/AD9850-waveform-generator/AD9850-waveform-generator.htm

Which in turn is based on AD9851 code from Andrew Smallbone - modified for AD9850

I have created the KiCad files for a board for this project.
